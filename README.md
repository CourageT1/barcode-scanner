# barcode-scanner
portifolio project for my ALX software engineering programm December 2023: I was trying to make a web app of a barcode scanner to use at a retail outlet. You scan a product`s barcode and it reflects back the price, expiry date and promotions related to that product with also an option to pay right ther for the product rather than still going to the till you can do an elotronic payment.

app.py:  This Python script defines a Flask web application for a project related to product management. Here's a detailed summary of the code:
Shebang and Docstring:
#!/usr/bin/python3: Specifies that the script should be interpreted using Python 3.
"""Flask app for the project""": A docstring providing a brief description of the purpose of the script.
Imports:
os: Provides a way to interact with the operating system, used for handling file paths.
Flask: The main class for creating a Flask web application.
render_template, request, jsonify: Functions from Flask for rendering templates, handling HTTP requests, and formatting JSON responses.
SQLAlchemy: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interacting with databases.
Migrate: A Flask extension for handling database migrations.
sys: A module providing access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter.
Flask App Configuration:
Configuration options for the Flask app, including the SQLite database URI, tracking modifications, and the upload folder for images.
Database Setup:
db = SQLAlchemy(): An instance of SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.
migrate = Migrate(): An instance of Flask-Migrate for handling database migrations.
Initialization of the app, the database, and migration instances.
Database Model:
Definition of a Product class, which is a SQLAlchemy model representing a product with various attributes like barcode, name, price, etc.
Routes:
Definition of several routes for rendering HTML templates:
'/': Landing page.
'/about': About page.
'/android-chrome-512x512.png': Handling favicon request.
'/promotions': Promotions page.
'/contacts': Contacts page.
'/scan': Scan page.
Two routes for handling form submissions:
'/scan' (POST method): Handles barcode scanning and queries the database for product information.
'/submit_product' (POST method): Handles the submission of product information.
File Upload Handling:

The 'submit_product' route includes logic to handle file uploads (images).
Run the Application:
if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True): This condition ensures that the app is only run when executed directly (not when imported as a module). The app runs in debug mode.
Overall, this script creates a Flask web application with routes for various pages, including a page for scanning barcodes and submitting product information. It utilizes SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Flask-Migrate for handling database migrations. The application allows users to view information, scan barcodes, and submit new products with associated details and images.

migrations.py:    handling database migrations using Flask-Migrate, a Flask extension that simplifies the process of managing database migrations with SQLAlchemy. Here's a detailed summary of the contents:

Shebang:

#!/usr/bin/python3: This is a shebang line specifying that the script should be interpreted using Python 3.
Documentation String:

"""handling migrations""": This is a triple-quoted string serving as a docstring. It provides a brief description indicating that the script is responsible for handling migrations.
Import Statements:

from flask_migrate import Migrate: Imports the Migrate class from the Flask-Migrate extension. This class is used to set up and control the migration process.

from app import app, db: Imports the app object and db object, presumably from the app module. app is a Flask application instance, and db is typically an instance of SQLAlchemy, a popular SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.

Migrate Object Initialization:

migrate = Migrate(app, db): Creates an instance of the Migrate class, associating it with the Flask application (app) and the SQLAlchemy database object (db). This initialization is crucial for managing migrations.
The script is part of a Flask application and is likely used in conjunction with a database created using SQLAlchemy. The Migrate instance is employed to handle database migrations, allowing for changes to the database schema as the application evolves over time. Migrations are essential when deploying changes to a production database without losing existing data.

gunicorn_config.py:  This Python script appears to be a configuration file for Gunicorn, a WSGI HTTP server commonly used for deploying web applications. Here's a detailed summary of the contents:
Shebang:
#!/usr/bin/python3: This is a shebang line specifying that the script should be interpreted using Python 3.
Documentation String:
"""gunicorn configuration""": This is a triple-quoted string serving as a docstring. In this case, it provides a brief description indicating that this file is a Gunicorn configuration.
Configuration Parameters:
workers = 4: This sets the number of worker processes that Gunicorn will spawn to handle incoming requests. Adjusting this value depends on factors such as server capacity and the workload.
bind = '0.0.0.0:8000': Specifies the IP address and port number to which Gunicorn should bind. In this case, it binds to all available network interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 8000.
module = 'app:app': Indicates the Python module that Gunicorn should import and run. In this example, it is set to 'app:app,' implying that the Gunicorn server will run the app object from the app module.
This configuration file is crucial when running Gunicorn to deploy a web application. It ensures that the server is appropriately configured with the desired number of worker processes, binding address, and the target application module. Adjustments to the number of workers and the binding address may be necessary based on the application's requirements and deployment environment.
